Jack Claw was a project in development at Frozenbyte during the years 2006-2008. It was a big-budget multiplatform game for next-gen consoles and PC. The project was canned in 2008 and the team set to work on Trine ( http://www.trine-thegame.com ) instead. More history on the project can be found at Frozenbyte's website or on the Jack Claw website, and more info on the transition from Jack Claw to Trine can be found in the Gamasutra postmortem: 
http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/5826/postmortem_frozenbytes_trine.php

This source code package allows you to compile the game and develop it further if you wish (for non-commercial purposes). All other Jack Claw files, including the art assets and the level editor, remain the sole property and copyright of Frozenbyte. You may not distribute any of the files not included in the source code package. Should the source code include any 3rd party files or software, the copyright remains with the original owner and you are not allowed to distribute or modify such files or software. It is also forbidden to distribute Jack Claw or any direct derivative, in any way (e.g. not even for free), in any "app stores" such as the Mac App Store or similar, or in any distribution channel that has authorization control by a third party. 

If you have a question about the license or a specific file, please don't hesitate to contact us. We're mostly just covering our legal base with this stuff. 

Please note that we cannot provide any official support for this source code release, although we will try to help where we can. 

If you are interested in developing Jack Claw, please get in touch with us or join the community - we are not actively developing the game on our own anymore but we are generally open to ideas, and our main interest is to just get the game out there and see what happens, and support the community with their ideas. 


WHAT YOU NEED
-------------

The source code as it is packaged will not compile properly. The following libraries have been deleted from the source code:

Boost 1.39.0
zlib 1.2.3
FMOD 3.75
DirectX SDK
PhysX SDK
Windows Media Format 9 Series SDK

Some of these are required in order to build the Jack Claw executable. 

We have licensed FMOD 3.7.5.0 for the Jack Claw project but no source code for FMOD can be distributed. If you require low-level access to the sound libraries, it's recommended you obtain a license to FMOD ( http://www.fmod.org ), or integrate OpenAL or other free sound library. 

DirectX SDK And Windows Media Format 9 Series SDK can be obtained from Microsoft.

PhysX SDK can be obtained from NVIDIA - see http://developer.nvidia.com/physx/ or
http://supportcenteronline.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=1949

More PhysX help: http://physxinfo.com/news/901/how-to-register-developer-account-to-get-physx-sdk-access/
and http://knol.google.com/k/introduction-to-the-nvidia-physx-api

You also needs the assets - the Jack Claw files, essentially the JackClaw_Editor_and_Assets.zip package, is available with the Humble Frozenbyte Bundle, or following the closure of the bundle, directly from Frozenbyte. 

Please go to the Jack Claw forums at http://frozenbyte.com/board/ for help. We'll try to set up a proper website/Wiki etc if there's enough interest in going forward from the community. 


SPECIAL NOTES
-------------

The Jack Claw source is based on the same code that we have used in all of our games so far. This will finally change with Trine 2 which uses a completely rewritten game engine. You will find a lot of code related to Shadowgrounds (2005) and Shadowgrounds Survivor (2007). There may also be references to older projects, such as "Disposable" or "DH", which mean our very first game, an  (RTS) prototype from 2001-2003. 

It's also worth noting that the source code has a lot of "hacks" and "todos". It is in many ways messy and could be hard to understand. 

We haven't had a commercial name for the game engine, but internally it's been called "Storm3D". Storm3D is partially based on work by the awesome Finnish programmer Sebastian Aaltonen, from whom we bought the original code in 2000/2001. 

That's it. We'll be discussing Jack Claw much more in the future on our websites and in the community, so be sure to check them out. 

Good luck! :)
