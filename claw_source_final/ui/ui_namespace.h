 * All user interface classes for that the game classes may use.
 * These classes work as the game's user interface.
 * They are allowed to depend on game classes but should not directly
 * change the state of the game classes!
 * In other words, these classes may ask the game classes for information
 * necessary to render the user interface, but are not allowed to change
 * the game's state. To change the game's state, a proper GameRequest should
 * be made (compare to network game).
