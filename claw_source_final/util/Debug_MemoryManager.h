/*
Debug versions of C++ heap memory handling operators. Using is 
transparent to client code. Note that this system might increase 
memory footprint considerably if you are allocating lots of small chunks.

This header doesn`t have to be included from client code. Operators
will be overrided anyway (on linking), this 'just' gives ability to
store allocations file / line number.
Should also be used on headers which do dynamic memory management. 
Just remember to #undef new to avoid breaking things later on.

Note that MSVC doesn't separate arrayed versions unless this header
is included from code.

This does the following:
	- Keeps list of all occured allocations
		-> Reports if forgot to delete some block (on exit)
		-> Reports if tried to delete unallocated block
	- Keeps some space around allocated buffer
		-> Detects most out-of-bounds writes
			-> Uses 4-byte boundary so with chars minor errors go undetected
		-> Checking done only on deallocation, can`t tell where it happened.
			-> Use validatePointer() on tricky situations
	- Notices if one tries to delete new[]`ed memory or vice versa
		-> Mixing array new/delete to normal versions, that is 
		-> At least on MSVC, requires including this header thought
			-> GCC works fine without it. Surprise, surprise
	- Reports has the information of where buffer was allocated
		-> Works only if included this header, though
		-> Filename & line number where it was allocated
   - Obeys all memory handling semantics with one exception
		-> Does not define a throw() version which would return 0-pointer on out-of-memory situations.
		-> That`s legacy anyway
	- Ability to query some useful statistics
		-> ToDo but see below
		
Started coding this on my own but later on found Paul Nettle's manager. 
Some ideas from there.
