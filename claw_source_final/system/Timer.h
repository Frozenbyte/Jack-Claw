/**
 * A simple class for getting time. Provides optimized way of querying
 * the system time. Requires the update method to be called every 
 * once a while or the returned time will not be properly updated.
 * (Zero time undefined, probably the start of program or last midnight.)
 * (Timer accuracy is also undefined, probably 10 ms or something alike,
 * but not guaranteed to be that.)
 *
 * @version 1.1, 1.10.2002
