	/**
	 * Latches the animations for UnitActors.
	 *
	 * We don't want to actually change the animation every time the
	 * unit is acting a certain thing, as there may be many other acting
	 * things going on, which may want another animation.
	 *
   * In other word, suppose a unit wishes to walk forward and therefore
	 * set the walk animation, but the unit happens to be dying at the same
	 * time (which therefore requires dying animation). So we cannot just 
	 * set the walk animation and ignore the other things going on, we 
	 * need to mark which animations are requested at that time and 
	 * use the most significant one(s). Which, in this case would be the 
	 * dying animation. The walk animation may not be set.
